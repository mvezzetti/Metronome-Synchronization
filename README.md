# Metronome-Synchronization

Mechanical metronomes placed on a light moveable base eventually synchronize, despite small differences in the intial frequencies. I used differential equations from the 2002 paper ["Synchronization of Metronomes"](https://aapt.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1119/1.1501118) by James Pantaleone to model the movement of two metronomes over time, then briefly examined how changing the parameters affected the time the metronomes took to synchronize. The notebook contains interactive widgets that allow the viewer to vary the initial conditions and variables associated with the movement of the metronomes, and see how this alters the motion and time they take to synchronize.
